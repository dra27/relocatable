# The aim of this script is to ensure that all the commits for a PR or branch
# push are fetched. Particularly for long-lived PRs, the relevant commits for
# the merge-base (i.e. the commit on trunk) will not be present by default.
# For force pushes, the same can be true for branches (e.g. a rebase)
# After running this script, 5 variables are available:
#   - FETCH_HEAD - the merge commit for a PR or the tip of the branch of a push
#   - UPSTREAM_BRANCH - the branch a PR is against or the full ref of the push
#   - UPSTREAM_SHA - the tip of UPSTREAM_BRANCH (prior to push, if applicable)
#   - PR_BRANCH - the PR's branch name; equal to $UPSTREAM_BRANCH for a push
#   - PR_HEAD - the tip of PR_BRANCH (so, for a push, the new tip after pushing)

# GitHub Actions doesn't support the ternary operator, so the dance is done here
# Each script has:
#   $1 - event type ('pull_request' or 'push')
#   $2 - upstream branch name
#   $3 - upstream branch SHA
#   $4 - PR branch name
#   $5 - PR SHA
#   $6 - full ref being pushed
#   $7 - upstream SHA prior to push
#   $8 - repeats $6
#   $9 - upstream SHA after the push
